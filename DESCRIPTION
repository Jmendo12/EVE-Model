Description: An implementation of the Expression variance evolution model in R.
    The EVE Model provides a new method for joint analyses of quantitative traits
    within and between species. The model parametrizes the ratio of population to
    evolutionary expression variance, and implements analyses such as a test for
    lineage specific shifts in expression level, and a phylogenetic ANOVA
    that can detect genes with increased or decreased ratios of expression
    divergence to diversity. The model can be used for purposes such as
    identifying genes with high expression divergence between species
    as candidates for expression level adaptation, and genes with
    high expression diversity within species as candidates for expression
    level conservation and or plasticity. The model can also be used for
    lineage-specific expression shifts in which candidate genes can be 
    determined for expression level adaptation.
